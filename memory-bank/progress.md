# Progress: DeepWriter MCP Server

## What Works
- Repository initialized.
- Memory Bank directory created with all required core files:
  - projectbrief.md
  - productContext.md
  - systemPatterns.md
  - techContext.md
  - activeContext.md
  - progress.md

## What's Left to Build
- Draft and document a detailed implementation plan for the DeepWriter MCP server.
- Scaffold the MCP server project (Node.js/TypeScript).
- Implement all required MCP tools (listProjects, getProjectDetails, createProject, updateProject, deleteProject, generateWork).
- Integrate with DeepWriter API endpoints.
- Implement error handling, security, logging, and resource exposure.
- Write and run tests for all tools and error cases.
- Document usage, maintenance, and update procedures.

## Current Status
- Memory Bank fully initialized.
- Ready to proceed with planning and implementation.

## Known Issues
- No code or server implementation exists yet.
- No tests or documentation for server usage yet.
