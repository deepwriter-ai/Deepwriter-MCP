# Progress: DeepWriter MCP Server

## What Works
- Repository initialized.
- Memory Bank directory created with all required core files.
- MCP server implementation with JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol support:
  - Proper handling of 'initialize' method calls with correct response format
  - Support for additional MCP protocol methods (notifications/initialized, tools/list, resources/list, tools/call)
  - Tool registry with all DeepWriter API tools
  - Response format transformation to match Claude's expectations
  - Error handling for invalid requests
  - TypeScript compilation and build process
- MCP server added to Claude's MCP settings for direct tool access

## What's Left to Build
- Enhance error handling for specific API error codes.
- Add more comprehensive logging.
- Implement resource exposure for API key validation, rate limits, etc.
- Write and run tests for all tools and error cases.
- Document usage, maintenance, and update procedures.

## Current Status
- MCP server implemented and updated to support JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol.
- Fixed initialization handshake issue with correct response format.
- Added support for all required MCP protocol methods.
- Added to Claude's MCP settings for direct tool access.
- Ready for testing with MCP clients.

## Known Issues
- Limited error handling for specific API error cases.
- No comprehensive test suite yet.
- Documentation needs to be updated to reflect protocol changes.
