# Project Brief: DeepWriter MCP Server

## Purpose
Develop a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with DeepWriter's API, exposing project management tools as MCP tools for seamless interaction.

## Core Requirements
- Implement an MCP server using stdio or SSE protocol.
- Provide tools for project CRUD operations and content generation, following the provided schemas.
- Securely handle DeepWriter API keys and ensure robust error handling.
- Log activity (excluding sensitive data) and provide resources for API key validation, rate limits, usage stats, error logs, and request history.
- Follow security best practices and maintain up-to-date documentation.

## Goals
- Enable users to manage DeepWriter projects via MCP tools.
- Ensure secure, reliable, and user-friendly integration.
- Facilitate easy maintenance and extensibility for future DeepWriter API changes.

## Scope
- All features and endpoints described in the implementation guide.
- Testing, error handling, and security as outlined.
- Documentation and ongoing maintenance procedures.
