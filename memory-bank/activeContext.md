# Active Context: DeepWriter MCP Server

## Current Work Focus
- Initializing the Memory Bank with all required core files.
- Planning the implementation of the DeepWriter MCP server according to the provided guide.
- No code or server files exist yet; only README.md and memory-bank/ are present.

## Recent Changes
- Created projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, and techContext.md in memory-bank/.
- Documented project purpose, context, architecture, and technology stack.

## Next Steps
1. Complete Memory Bank initialization (activeContext.md, progress.md).
2. Develop a detailed implementation plan for the MCP server, referencing the user’s guide and schemas.
3. Present the plan to the user for feedback and approval.
4. Upon approval, document the plan and switch to implementation mode.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Following the user’s implementation guide as the source of truth.
- Prioritizing security, error handling, and maintainability.
- Using Node.js/TypeScript for the MCP server.
- Ensuring all Memory Bank files are up to date before proceeding to implementation.
