# Active Context: DeepWriter MCP Server

## Current Work Focus
- Debugging and fixing the MCP server to handle the newer JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol format.
- Ensuring proper initialization handshake with MCP clients.

## Recent Changes
- Updated the MCP server to support the JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol format.
- Fixed the request handling to properly process 'initialize' method calls.
- Updated the response format to match the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification.
- Fixed TypeScript type definitions for the tool registry.
- Fixed the initialization response format to include required fields:
  - Added protocolVersion
  - Changed tools format from array to object
  - Added serverInfo object
- Added support for additional MCP protocol methods:
  - notifications/initialized
  - tools/list
  - resources/list
  - resources/templates/list
  - tools/call
- Transformed tool response formats to match Claude's expectations:
  - For listProjects: transformed projects array to content array

## Next Steps
1. Test the MCP server with a client to ensure it properly handles the initialization handshake.
2. Verify that tool calls work correctly with the updated protocol.
3. Consider adding more robust error handling and logging.
4. Update documentation to reflect the protocol changes.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Updated the server to use JSON-RPC 2.0 format for MCP protocol compatibility.
- Added proper handling for the 'initialize' method to support the handshake process.
- Maintained the existing tool execution logic while updating the request/response format.
- Ensured TypeScript type safety throughout the changes.
