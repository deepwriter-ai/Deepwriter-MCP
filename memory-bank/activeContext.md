# Active Context: DeepWriter MCP Server

## Current Work Focus
- Completed comprehensive API migration to latest DeepWriter APIs
- Successfully modernized MCP server with enhanced capabilities
- Ready for production testing and deployment

## Recent Changes - API Migration (Latest)
- **API Base URL Migration**: Updated from `https://www.deepwriter.com/api` to `https://app.deepwriter.com/api`
- **generateWork â†’ generateWizardWork**: Complete replacement with enhanced functionality:
  - Added 13+ comprehensive parameters (prompt, author, email, outline_text, technical diagrams, TOC, web research, page_length, questions_and_answers, mode, max_pages, free_trial_mode, isDefault)
  - Support for multiple generation modes (deepwriter, benchmark, romance, homework, deepseek, skunkworks)
  - Question/answer refinement system integration
- **New formatPrompt Tool**: AI-powered prompt enhancement with project file integration
- **New uploadProjectFiles Tool**: Multi-file upload with 20+ supported file types (PDF, Word, text, code, data files)

- **MCP Server Registration**: All new tools properly registered with comprehensive validation

## Previous Protocol Updates (Maintained)
- JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol support with proper initialization handshake
- Tool response format transformation for Claude compatibility
- Error handling for invalid requests and comprehensive logging
- Resource exposure capabilities for API validation and usage tracking

## Next Steps
1. Conduct end-to-end testing with Claude and MCP clients
2. Verify all new tools function correctly with real API calls
3. Test file upload functionality with various file types
4. Validate prompt enhancement workflow with project integration
5. Performance testing and optimization

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Clean Break Migration**: Completely removed generateWork as requested (no backward compatibility)
- **Enhanced Parameter Support**: Full support for all new DeepWriter wizard parameters
- **File Upload Architecture**: Implemented FormData handling with comprehensive validation
- **Error Handling Strategy**: Enhanced validation and detailed error reporting for all new endpoints
- **Type Safety**: Maintained strict TypeScript coverage throughout migration
