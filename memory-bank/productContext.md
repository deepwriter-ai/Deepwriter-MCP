# Product Context: DeepWriter MCP Server

## Why This Project Exists
DeepWriter users need a streamlined way to manage their writing projects programmatically and securely. Integrating DeepWriter with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables automation, tool interoperability, and advanced workflows for writers, developers, and teams.

## Problems Solved
- Manual project management is time-consuming and error-prone.
- Lack of integration with automation tools and external systems.
- Difficulty securely handling API keys and sensitive data.
- Inconsistent error handling and lack of visibility into API usage.

## How It Should Work
- Users provide their DeepWriter API key to the MCP server.
- The server exposes tools for listing, creating, updating, deleting, and generating content for projects.
- All interactions are secure, with robust error handling and clear feedback.
- Users can access usage statistics, error logs, and request history for transparency.

## User Experience Goals
- Simple, secure API key management.
- Fast, reliable project operations.
- Clear error messages and actionable feedback.
- Easy integration with other MCP-compatible tools and workflows.
- Maintainable and extensible for future DeepWriter features.
